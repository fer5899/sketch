# Sketch it up! project

This is the second of The Odin Project projects with Javascript. I designed a web application to do simple sketches on a canvas of variable resolution. It's possible to paint in black, in increasing shades of black with every pass or in random colors.

With this project I mainly practiced changing CSS properties in Javascript.
